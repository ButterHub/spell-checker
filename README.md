# c-past-questions
C past papers and other practice questions at Imperial. 

e.g. Spell checker mock test done on 10/12/2019. All unassessed coursework questions complete (Except Braille).

## Notable/ difficult questions:
- Q3-palindrome/anagram: Requires sorting algorithm
- Q5-Piglatin: Reading in characters (.get()) worked well. Reading in words (>>) went badly.
- Q2-soundex: Count function logic is messy
